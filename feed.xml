            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://vsitante.github.io/your_content/comics/height/height1.png" alt_text="Black and white simple-looking comic. This has five panels. We start with the little girl and her mother in the first panel. Kumiko says Thank you for the drink, mami! (She looks happy) Astemar says You&#x27;re welcome! (She looks pleased) Still looking pleased, Astemar: Kumiko tries so hard despite her size...Sure is a shame--that she has to stay small--Suddenly, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, and American sitcom-style, we see that Kumiko is now older and taller! Kumiko says Do you want a drink, mami? Kumiko looks happy and waiting, while Astemar considers her life choices in life, her pleased expression not changing."></p>

<hr>

<p>Hashed this out pretty quickly, by my standards!</p>

<p>I came up with this idea randomly while writing more prose and figuring out character stuff while doing so. Though Astemar being the shortest in the family was always a thing...so :D</p>
